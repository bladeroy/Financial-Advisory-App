# AI Startup with PyTorch

## Overview

This is the code which I build for an Finance Startup.

## Dependencies

- Firebase
- Plaid
- Tensorflow Lite
- DialogFlow
- AnyChart

## Instructions

Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) then import this project. Since I've placed the dependencies in the build.gradle file, it should auto-download them for you, which is awesome. It needs more features, and better integrated dataflow. I could've put more time into it, but I'm on to the next one. The model was too big to upload to GitHub. Place any .pb model into the app/src/main/assets folder and Tensorflow lite will detect it so it can be used for inference.

## Credits 

So many people. I stand on the shoulders of giants. Respect to all developers.
